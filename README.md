I'm 17 years old. I'm a game programmer.
I learned to program on my own, online, without using paid courses. 

My journey probably began in 2017 or 2018, when I started producing games on BGE (Blender Game Engine). 
I didn't use Python code, but I used the engine's visual logic system to produce my games. 
I made several, but unfortunately I don't have access to them, because 
I ended up deleting them and not storing them on the web. However, I don't think I should 
worry too much about it, especially because such projects were extremely poorly optimized 
and didn't last long to play.

After 2 or 3 years, at the end of 2020 and heading into 2021, I started to get interested in Unity,
and ended up switching to it, due to the suggestion of people close to me. As you know, this engine uses
the C# language for programming, but it also has the bolt system for visual handling. Influenced by many
channels I watched on YouTube, I opted for lines of code. That was when I really began my adventure in 
game programming. Unfortunately, I also deleted my Unity projects, because I was a kid and very foolish,
not knowing that I could use them to build my future career. I really regret not having saved those...

A year went by, and I started to get tired of using Unity. I wanted to learn something more complex, and 
I felt that I could learn a lot more about programming if I had to produce more robust and sophisticated 
structures. The solution I found was to start studying C++ and use SFML to produce my games. That's when 
I found a lower level of programming to challenge my computational skills.

I learned the C++ language through articles and videos that I found on the internet. I practiced a lot, 
putting the concepts into practice, mainly by making games in SFML. It was really cool! Of course, it was
also kind of difficult, because even though I searched for tutorials on the internet in English, I couldn't
find enough material to solve my problems; so I was often forced to produce my own solutions to meet the needs
of my projects. This was extremely beneficial, because it made me learn even more concepts of C++ programming 
and trained my programming logic a lot.

Among the projects I produced, I made one about a spaceship, which you control and shoot at others that spawn randomly.

There is also Space Invaders, where I used polymorphism for the first time.

With not very similar relevance, I created the Snake Game. There is nothing to comment on, it is simply the Snake Game.

Another was a platform game, where you had a little gun, and you had to collect ammunition from the scene to shoot with it. 
You went through the levels, killed some enemies, and then collected donuts along the way to improve your score. 
The final level was the biggest and the most difficult, but not too impossible. There are two versions of it: one extremely
poorly programmed, and another, a thousand times better and well constructed.

Last but not least, I'm currently working on a game I started 2 or 1.5 years ago, with many stops and turns. This is Legendaria,
a game inspired by Terraria. It's my dream project! Terraria is my favorite game, and it's in my heart in an unimaginable way, 
and making a game inspired by it is something very exciting for me. I already have a lot of stuff in it: equipment, world 
generation system (it's still in progress, but it already works), inventory, system for breaking and placing blocks, some
enemies, equipment, armor... In short, most of the elements of Terraria. If you want to know more about this project, you can
check out Legendaria in the other repository and read what's there.
